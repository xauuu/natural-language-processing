You have to use the original QCN backup from Poco F3 or another QCN that comes from the same baseband version and chipset model. Still, there is an RSA key resistor that protects the software to avoid dual IMEI repair, you will only be able to write a single IMEI except you're doing modification on hardware (there is a resistor need to be removed or replaced with a particular value).\n\nIn that guy's case, mistakenly untick EFS protection when using auth flash from Xiaomi Pro Tools."}, {"username": "entekss", "message": "Try Fartory (fastboot)rom.My be returns to normal.\nEng Rom Link :https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A3U9j3q3PEjQNc6qGT473i1qthhorDQq/view?usp=sharing"}, {"username": "ReisenUI", "message": "Last month I tried flashing the .img files to the modem and modemst partitions under the bootloader, and then my baseband was lost. \nFinnaly I paid ￥60 to someone to restore the baseband using the modem.img and modemst.img I had backed up before.

Lmao serves him right karma qt work.\n\nMaybe he actually managed to keep the files ? Usually when you hire someone they delete the files when done... But from the message above it is said that he clicked the wrong btton when flashing, maybe he said he wanted to do it himself under supervision?
