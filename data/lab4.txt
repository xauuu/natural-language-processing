The tourism industry wants the Ho Chi Minh City government to revive the night-time economy with more amusement options and later closure of businesses.
Ngo Thanh Thuy of Rex Hotel in District 1 said at a meeting with city authorities Thursday that Le Loi Street, one of the busiest tourism areas, lacks nighttime amusement activities to engage foreign visitors.
After the street is cleared of the metro construction site, they should turn it into a street food hub with entertainment shows to help widen nighttime travel experiences, he said.
Huynh Phan Phuong Hoang, deputy general director of tour operator Vietravel, too called on the city to open street food hubs and launch more night-time entertainment to give foreigners more reason to extend their stay in Vietnam's premier metropolis.
Le Quynh Thu, CEO of Apex MultiMedia, said the city has abundant resources to develop its night-time economy and authorities should allow some businesses to stay open until 4 a.m.
HCMC has two pedestrian-only plazas and a street that is off-limits to vehicles.
The plazas are near the Quang Trung Monument in District 10 and on the center strip on Nguyen Hue Street.
Bui Vien Street is pedestrian-only from 7 p.m. during weekends.
This year the city has received 2.1 million foreign visitors, or 60% of its target of 3.5 million.
In 2019, the year before Covid began, it had received over 8.6 million, or nearly half the total foreign arrivals in Vietnam.
